Specialization Summary


## Generative AI: Introduction and Applications
* discriminative AI mimics our analytical and predictive skills, generative AI goes a step further to mimic our creative skills.
* tools
    * text generation: GPT(generative pre-train transformer), Bard
    * image generation: DALL*E 2, Midjourney
        * GANs (generative adversarial networks), VAEs (Variational autoencoders)
        * StyleGAN: high-quality, high-resolution novel images
        * DeepArt: complex and detailed artwork from a sketch
        * Dall*E: Novel images based on texztual descriptions
    * audio generation
        * application
            * musical compositions
            * text-to-speech (TTS) audio
            * Synthetic voices
            * Natural-sounding speech
        * tools
            * WaveGAN: raw audio waveforms, realistic sounds (speech, music, environmental noises)
            * OpenAI's MuseNet: original music in various genres and instrumentations, classical compositions to pop songs
            * Google's Tacotron 2 / Mozilla TTS: advanced TTS, highly realistic synthetic speech (tone, pitch, modulation, pronunciation, rhythm, expressions)
        * capability: media, creativity, entertainment, training and education, gaming, virtual reality
    * video generation: Synthesia
        * capability: create basic animations to complex scenes, transform images into dynamic videos, incorporate temporal coherence, exhibit smooth motion and transitions
        * capability: art, entertainment, education, gaming, medicine, research 
        * videoGPT
    * Code generation: copilot, AlphaCode 
        * capability: code snippets, functions, complete programs
        * code generation: complete or create code, synthesize or refactor the code, identify and fix bugs in the code, test softward, create documentation
        * capability: softward and web development, ml and nlp, data science and analytics, robotic and automation, virtual game and AR/VR encironment development, audio video and speech processing 
    * data generation and augmentation capabilities of generative AI
