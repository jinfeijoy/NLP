## Learn AI Agents
_ai agent: like a project manager to take actions and made decisions based on contect to achieve a specific goal or set of goals. the agent operates autonomously, meaning it is not directly controlled by a  human operator_
* prompt engineering / chain-of-thought prompting: is the art of getting AI to do what you want
    * be specific / Use technical terms / provide context / give examples / iterate 
    * specify the length of responses / specify the format of responses / 
* agents
    * LLM /text to speech / image generation / CV
    * setup
* agent tools/functions
    * chain: call function to get some data -> pass data to LLM to reason about -> get response from LLM
* building a ReAct Agent (reasoning + acting)
    * reasoning: think about what steps or additional information you might require to accomplish your task
    * acting: perform an action to help you get closer to your ultimate goal
    * observing: observe the results of the action you performed, and start back at reasoning when necessary, otherwise, give the completed response to the user
