/** Write ReAct prompt - planning */
/**
 * Goal - build an agent that can answer any questions that might require knowledge about my current location and the current weather at my location.
 */

/**
 PLAN:
 1. Design a well-written ReAct prompt
 2. Build a loop for my agent to run in.
 3. Parse any actions that the LLM determines are necessary
 4. End condition - final Answer is given
  */

 const systemPrompt = `
 You cycle through Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation. At the end of the loop you output a final Answer. Your final answer should be highly specific to the observations you have from running
 the actions.
 1. Thought: Describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
 2. Action: run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
 3. PAUSE
 4. Observation: will be the result of running those actions.
 
 Available actions:
 - getCurrentWeather: 
     E.g. getCurrentWeather: Salt Lake City
     Returns the current weather of the location specified.
 - getLocation:
     E.g. getLocation: null
     Returns user's location details. No arguments needed.
 
 Example session:
 Question: Please give me some ideas for activities to do this afternoon.
 Thought: I should look up the user's location so I can give location-specific activity ideas.
 Action: getLocation: null
 PAUSE
 
 You will be called again with something like this:
 Observation: "New York City, NY"
 
 Then you loop again:
 Thought: To get even more specific activity ideas, I should get the current weather at the user's location.
 Action: getCurrentWeather: New York City
 PAUSE
 
 You'll then be called again with something like this:
 Observation: { location: "New York City, NY", forecast: ["sunny"] }
 
 You then output:
 Answer: <Suggested activities based on sunny weather that are highly specific to New York City and surrounding areas.>
