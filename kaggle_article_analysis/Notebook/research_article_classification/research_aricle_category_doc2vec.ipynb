In particular we study the\\ntheory of zonal polyharmonics, which allows us, analogously to zonal harmonics,\\nto construct Poisson kernels for polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated\\nballs. We find the representation of Poisson kernels and zonal polyharmonics in\\nterms of the Gegenbauer polynomials. We show the connection between the\\nclassical Poisson kernel for harmonic functions on the ball, Poisson kernels\\nfor polyharmonic functions on the union of rotated balls, and the Cauchy-Hua\\nkernel for holomorphic functions on the Lie ball.\\n   \n",
