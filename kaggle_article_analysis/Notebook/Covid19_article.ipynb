      "If you've recently heard from an old friend, you're not alone. A communication studies professor says he's not surprised that people are looking to reconnect with others they were once close to. “This is an utter reshuffling of people's social lives, in a way that's very, very dramatic and probably different than anything we've ever seen before,” said Dr. Jeffrey Hall, Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Kansas. Dr. Hall has been working with colleagues to collect data on how people are getting social needs met while in quarantine. One thing they've found so far is that taking the initiative to reach out can improve mental health. Dr. Hall has also been exploring why we don't normally keep in touch, even though it's easier than ever with technology. He says we typically get enough social interaction just through casual conversations with others, like at work or in your neighborhood. However, that's changed. “We don't have that,” said Dr. Hall. “So, what that means is we basically have a huge gap of people who we would normally make sense of the world with, and that's being replaced by either the people who are in our households, or people who we have, prior to, not seen very often.\n"

(KGTV) — Joining Oceanside and California state beaches, Carlsbad city officials announced Friday that they will close beach parking lots for the July 4 weekend. The city says that beach parking lots will be closed July 4 and 5 in Carlsbad, over concerns of crowds from counties where beaches are closed traveling to the region.

RELATED: Crowds flock to San Diego beaches for Fourth of July weekendEarlier this week, San Diego County Supervisors said they did not plan to mandate county beaches to close and would leave it up to cities to decide themselves. \"At the time of writing, beaches under the jurisdiction of local governments within San Diego County are the only beaches without visitation restrictions throughout all of Southern California, and therefore are attracting thousands of residents from outside your coastal communities and creating significant potential for disease transmission, particularly in crowded restaurants, bars, retail, and hotels,\" Cal OES wrote in a letter to the cities of San Diego, Imperial Beach, Coronado, Del Mar, Solana Beach, Encinitas, Carlsbad, and Oceanside. \"To protect the public health of San Diegans and reduce the high potential transmission of this deadly disease in San Diego coastal businesses, we write to request that municipal governments do not open beach parking lots for the July 4th holiday weekend. \"Beaches in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Venture Counties are closed this weekend amid surging coronavirus cases in the state. California closed state beach parking lots, including those in San Diego County, ahead of Saturday. The global pandemic has changed what “work” looks like for millions of people, and those changes could become permanent, according to workplace and hiring experts.\n",
