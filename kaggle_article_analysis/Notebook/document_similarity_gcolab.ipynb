activated Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Company   BHAC   as an insurer of the tax exempt bonds issued by states, cities and other local entities  BHACinsures these securities for issuers both atthetimetheirbondsaresoldtothepublic primary transactions  andlater,whenthebondsarealreadyowned byinvestors secondarytransactions   By yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business had allfallenintobigtrouble ThecauseoftheirproblemswascapturedlongagobyMaeWest  IwasSnowWhite, butIdrifted   The monolines  as the bond insurers are called  initially insured only tax exempt bonds that were low risk  But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell  Faced with the prospect of stagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever riskier propositions  Some of these involved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations  When housing prices plummeted, the monoline industryquicklybecameabasketcase  Early in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax exempts that was on the books of the three largest monolines  These companies were all in life threatening trouble  though they said   otherwise   We would have charged a 112  rate to take over the guarantees on about  822 billion of bonds  If our offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who owned these bonds   a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases  Ours was not a frivolous proposal  For reasons wewillcometolater,itinvolvedsubstantialriskforBerkshire  The monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two  In the end, though, the turndowns proved to be very good news for us, because it became apparent that I had severely underpricedouroffer  Thereafter, we wrote about  15 6 billion of insurance in the secondary market  And here s the punch line  About 77  of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementioned monolines Intheseagreements,wehavetopayfordefaultsonlyiftheoriginalinsurerisfinanciallyunabletodo so  Wewrotethis second to pay insuranceforratesaveraging3 3  That sright wehavebeenpaidfar more for becoming the second to pay than the 1 5  wewouldhaveearlier chargedtobethefirst topay Inone extreme case, we actually agreed to be fourth to pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1  premium charged by the monoline that remains first to pay  In other words, three other monolines have to first go broke beforeweneedtowriteacheck  Two of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital  This, of course, directly helps us, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term, any claims on our second to pay insurance because these two monolines fail  In addition to our book of secondary business, we have also written  3 7 billion of primary business for a premium of  96 million  In primarybusiness,ofcourse,wearefirsttopayiftheissuergetsintrouble  We have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any other monoline  Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs  This explains why many sophisticated investors have bought second to pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by another monoline BHAChasbecomenotonlytheinsurerofpreference,butinmanycasesthesoleinsureracceptableto bondholders  Nevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a sure thingthatthisinsurancewillultimatelybeprofitableforus Thereasonissimple,thoughIhaveneverseeneven apassingreferencetoitbyanyfinancialanalyst,ratingagencyormonolineCEO  13The rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax exempts has been that defaults have historically been few  But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsured bonds  Insuranceoftax exemptbondsdidn texistbefore1971,andevenafterthatmostbondsremaineduninsured  A universe of tax exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat different loss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being how different  To understand why, let s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy  At the time its bonds   virtually all uninsured   were heavily held by the city s wealthier residents as well as by New York banksandotherinstitutions Theselocalbondholdersdeeplydesiredtosolvethecity sfiscalproblems Sobefore long, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution  Without one, it was apparent to all that New York s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severe financiallossesfromtheirbondholdings  Now, imagine that all of the city s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire  Would similar belt  tightening,taxincreases,laborconcessions,etc havebeenforthcoming Ofcoursenot Ataminimum,Berkshire would have been asked to  share  in the required sacrifices  And, considering our deep pockets, the required contributionwouldmostcertainlyhavebeensubstantial  Local governments are going to face far tougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date  The pension liabilities I talked about in last year s report will be a huge contributor to these woes  Many cities andstatesweresurelyhorrifiedwhentheyinspectedthestatusoftheirfundingatyearend2008 Thegapbetween assetsandarealisticactuarialvaluationofpresentliabilitiesissimplystaggering  When faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will be more prone to develop  solutions  less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsured bonds held by local banks and residents  Losses in the tax exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to be highly correlated among issuers  If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance that others will follow in their footsteps will grow  What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to local citizensintheformofmajortaxincreasesoverpaintoafar awaybondinsurer  Insuring tax exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business   one with similarities, in fact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes  In both cases, a string of loss free years can be followed

models of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error  Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financial marketsasguidestofutureaction  Ifmerelylookinguppastfinancialdatawouldtellyouwhatthefutureholds, theForbes400wouldconsistoflibrarians   Indeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage related securities came in large part because of flawed, history based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors  These parties looked at loss experience over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses wasnegligible  Theythen made this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses  They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had

            A final post script on BHAC  Who, you may wonder, runs this operation  While I help set policy, all of the heavy lifting is done by Ajit and his crew  Sure, they were already generating

swung wildly from a profitof 327millioninthesecondquarterof2008toalossof 693millioninthefourthquarterof 2008  Surprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only  97 million last year, far below

say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a  100 million contract, we are obligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ s debt   If, for example, the company s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe  70 million   For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which our insuranceexpires  At yearend we had written  4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receive annual premiums of  93 million  This is the only derivatives business we write that has any counterpartyrisk thepartythatbuysthecontractfromusmustbegoodforthequarterlypremiums it will owe us over the five years  We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent because most buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter into suchanarrangement    At the request of our customers, we write a few tax exempt bond insurance contracts that are similar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives  The only meaningful difference between the two contracts is that mark to market accounting is required for derivatives whereasstandardaccrualaccountingisrequiredatBHAC  19But this difference can produce some strange results  The bonds covered   in effect, insured   by
