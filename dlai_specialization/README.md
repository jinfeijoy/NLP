 #### Week3
 * [training naive bayese steps](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp/supplement/0imfM/training-naive-bayes)
    * preprocessing: 
    * word counts ( compute freq(w,class)): 
    * P(w|class)
    * get lambda
    * get the log prior = log(P(pos)/P(neg))
* [Error analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp/supplement/clcHR/error-analysis):several mistakes may cause misclassifying
    * removing punctuation (e.g. removing :( may cause sentiment analysis error)
    * removing words (e.g. removing 'not')
    * word order
    * Adversarial attacks: These include sarcasm, irony, euphemisms.
